The first half of 2023 has been the hottest on record, with global temperatures **1.44 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th century average**. This is a clear sign that climate change is accelerating, and that we need to take urgent action to reduce our emissions.

The consequences of climate change are already being felt around the world. We are seeing more extreme weather events, such as heat waves, droughts, floods, and wildfires. These events are causing widespread damage to property and infrastructure, and are displacing millions of people.

Climate change is also having a significant impact on the economy. The cost of extreme weather events is rising, and businesses are facing increased costs for energy, insurance, and other climate-related risks.

The good news is that there are things we can do to reduce our [emissions](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/emission) and mitigate the effects of climate change. We need to invest in [renewable energy](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-renewable-energy), improve energy efficiency, and transition to a low-carbon economy. We also need to make changes to our lifestyles, such as driving less, eating less meat, and recycling more.


The future of our planet depends on our actions today. We need to take urgent action to reduce our emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change. The time to act is now.

In the business world, there are a number of things that companies can do to address climate change. These include:

- Investing in renewable energy
- Improving energy efficiency
- Reducing their carbon footprint
- Reporting on their climate-related risks and opportunities
- Supporting policies that address climate change

By taking these steps, businesses can help to reduce emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change. They can also improve their bottom line, as climate-friendly practices can lead to lower costs and increased profits.

The future of our planet depends on the actions of businesses today. By taking steps to address climate change, businesses can help to create a more sustainable future for all.
